## Code submitted for code review on 08/26/2022

Order for scripts to be run:
1) Anything including "dataclean" - cleans data and stores the subsequent files to be consolidated at a later step
2) Analysis - generally the analysis using values interpolated from standard curves (NOT IN USE) but these data are used for the AUC calculation.
3) Auc (in use as it allows for the inclusion of all data points)
